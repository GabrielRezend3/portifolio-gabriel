        <h3>üöÄ More about me:</h3>
        <h1> <span>A bit of my lore:</span></h1>
        <p> Hey! I'm Gabriel. I've been around computers from an early age, and my passion for them has only grown ever since. <br> <br>

            I've always loved exploring how software works, often experimenting to find ways to exploit mechanics in video games, which I enjoy immensely. Back in 2020, I started teaching myself how to code and dove into cybersecurity as a hobby. I quickly fell in love with the field, and today, I program in various languages and technologies, constantly striving to sharpen my skills. <br>
            
            I'm deeply curious and passionate about learning. I believe the best way to grow is by offering my skills and services to meet the needs of others. <br>
            
            When I'm not coding or diving into Capture the Flag challenges, I enjoy playing games with my friends, reading manga, hitting the gym, and practicing jiu-jitsu! ü•ã <br> <br> 
            A special thanks to my family, especially to my father and mother, and to my aunt and uncle Sonia and Moises who always believed in me, without your support this journey would be impossible. My eternal gratitude to all. üôè</p>
